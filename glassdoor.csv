In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.",3.6,"Afterpay

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

261,Machine Learning Scientist,$108K - $138K (Glassdoor Est.),"Seeing Machines works with the world's leading OEMs to deliver state-of-the-art operator monitoring technology across our chosen transport sectors of commercial road transport (Fleet), automotive, and aviation. In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

504,Machine Learning Scientist,$108K - $138K (Glassdoor Est.),"Seeing Machines works with the world's leading OEMs to deliver state-of-the-art operator monitoring technology across our chosen transport sectors of commercial road transport (Fleet), automotive, and aviation. In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

About Seeing Machines
Seeing Machines is currently in a consultation process around a proposed vaccination policy for its Australian offices. The policy proposes to require all employees and visitors to all Seeing Macjomes sites be fully vaccinated. Whilst the policy may or may not be implemented following consultation, Seeing Machines wants to ensure all candidates within our current recruitment processes were aware of this. Should a decision on the policy be made in the coming weeks, further correspondence will be circulated.
Seeing Machines is a world leader in driver-machine interaction. We harness human factors science to create artificial intelligence (AI) technology that observes the driver's attention – reliably, unobtrusively, and in real time – and intervenes seamlessly when necessary.
Specialised computer vision algorithms underpin Seeing Machines' core camera-based driver monitoring technology. Algorithms allow us to precisely track eye gaze, head position and pupil size while our state-of-the-art AI technology analyses the data to quickly and accurately detect driver drowsiness, distraction and microsleep levels. We work with some of the world's leading brands to deliver this technology, helping keep drivers and operators engaged across commercial transport and logistics, automotive, aviation, rail and mining industries.
In automotive, we enable safer Automated Driving (AD) solutions and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) – including the world first camera-based hands-free driving feature, GM Super Cruise. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
For commercial transport and fleet operators, the Seeing Machines retrofit driver monitoring technology provides real-time intervention for drivers to mitigate the risks associated with driver fatigue and distraction.

744,Machine Learning Scientist,$108K - $138K (Glassdoor Est.),"Seeing Machines works with the world's leading OEMs to deliver state-of-the-art operator monitoring technology across our chosen transport sectors of commercial road transport (Fleet), automotive, and aviation. In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

984,Machine Learning Scientist,$108K - $138K (Glassdoor Est.),"Seeing Machines works with the world's leading OEMs to deliver state-of-the-art operator monitoring technology across our chosen transport sectors of commercial road transport (Fleet), automotive, and aviation. In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.
