In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

Machine Learning Scientist,$108K - $138K (Glassdoor Est.),"Seeing Machines works with the world's leading OEMs to deliver state-of-the-art operator monitoring technology across our chosen transport sectors of commercial road transport (Fleet), automotive, and aviation. In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

Machine Learning Scientist,$108K - $138K (Glassdoor Est.),"Seeing Machines works with the world's leading OEMs to deliver state-of-the-art operator monitoring technology across our chosen transport sectors of commercial road transport (Fleet), automotive, and aviation. In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

Reporting to the Director, Monash Data Futures Institute, this exciting new position will be instrumental in collaborating with clients, stakeholders and researchers as well as a team of researchers and AI practitioners to deploy machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to solve client-based business and research challenges. The position will be required to deliver timely advice in the development of work statements describing the problem to be addressed and leading implementation of the methods for resolving these through AI and Data Science in the form of code, algorithmic software and/or prototype systems, to a range of organisations.",4.2,Monash University,Clayton North,10000+ Employees,1958,College / University,Colleges & Universities,Education,$2 to $5 billion (USD),0,0,73-99,73,99,86.0,1958.0,62.0
Machine Learning Scientist,$108K - $138K (Glassdoor Est.),"Seeing Machines works with the world's leading OEMs to deliver state-of-the-art operator monitoring technology across our chosen transport sectors of commercial road transport (Fleet), automotive, and aviation. In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

Machine Learning Scientist,$108K - $138K (Glassdoor Est.),"Seeing Machines works with the world's leading OEMs to deliver state-of-the-art operator monitoring technology across our chosen transport sectors of commercial road transport (Fleet), automotive, and aviation. In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.

Machine Learning Scientist,$108K - $138K (Glassdoor Est.),"Seeing Machines works with the world's leading OEMs to deliver state-of-the-art operator monitoring technology across our chosen transport sectors of commercial road transport (Fleet), automotive, and aviation. In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments – leading to better training and safer operations.
The Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple – just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc.

About the opportunity
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both.
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.
