# Glassdoor Data Science Salary Project

##
As a beginner learning data science and coding, this is a project that I started following Ken Gee's Data Science From Scratch YouTube video. While I was following, I soon realised there was a lot of code and files that were deprecated. Because of this I had to research external resources to debugging the code, which I will outline further later. However, due to all the troubleshooting this turned out to be a great learning experience, gaining knowledge of the selenium package, XPath, and some HTML.
