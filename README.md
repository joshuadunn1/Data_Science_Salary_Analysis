# Australia Data Science Salary Analysis

## Introduction
As a beginner learning data science and coding, this is a project that I started following Ken Gee's Data Science From Scratch YouTube video. While I was following, I soon realised there was a lot of code and files that were deprecated. Because of this I had to research external resources to debugging the code, which I will outline further later. However, due to all the troubleshooting this turned out to be a great learning experience, gaining knowledge of the selenium package, XPath, and some HTML.
In this project I:
* Debugged depracated code to scrape 1000 job descriptions from Glassdoor using python and selenium.
* Data cleaning
* Exploratory analysis of our dataset to attain insights into the field of data science in Australia
* I am currently working on machine learning models to estimate salaries

## Results  
Results of data scraped from 1000 job ads on glassdoor.
